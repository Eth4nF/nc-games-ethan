      "Few games are equiped to fill a player with such a defined sense of mild-peril, but a friendly game of Jenga will turn the mustn't-make-it-fall anxiety all the way up to 11! Fiddly fun for all the family, this game needs little explaination. Whether you're a player who chooses to play it safe, or one who lives life on the edge, eventually the removal of blocks will destabilise the tower and all your Jenga dreams come tumbling down.",

      "Cold rain pours on the faces of your team of cyclists, you pulled to the front of the pack early and now your taking on exhaustion cards like there is not tomorrow, you think there are about 2 hands left until you cross the finish line, will you draw enough from your deck to cross before the other team shoot passed? Flamee Rouge is a Racing deck management game where you carefully manage your deck in order to cross the line before your opponents, cyclist can fall slyly behind front runners in their slipstreams to save precious energy for the prefect moment to burst into the lead ",

Buyer beware: once you gain a reputation for being able to lie with a stone face about being the secret killer you may never lose it.",

      "Spend 30 minutes just setting up all of the boards (!) meeple and decks, just to forget how to play. Scythe can be a lengthy game but really packs a punch if you put the time in. With beautiful artwork, countless scenarios and clever game mechanics, this board game is a must for any board game fanatic; just make sure you explain ALL the rules before you start playing with first timers or you may find they bring it up again and again.",

      "For some preface here I'll give you a bit of back ground. I'm a senior in an all boys high school and I never really knew any girls in my time here. I never really focused on it, you know? Well anyway, seniors go on a retreat for three days and its all about brotherhood and stuff like that.I was having an alright time until we had free time where some kids brought a game I'd heard about from Reddit before; Secret Hitler. I had trouble getting into it but the group I was with showed me the ropes and I made a pretty good game as a fascist. Free time ends and we go back to our normal BS, everyone is still excited from the game and can't wait to play it tomorrow. Well the next day free time rolls around and we hurry to our table to play. This time we all get seriously into it, shouting expletives at each other so loud that the entire complex can hear it and all that. Eventually we have about 20 minutes left and we decide to do one more game. The cards are passed out and I'm Hitler, its my first time. I proceed to have the most fantastic match as Hitler ever witnessed, I was trusted by all the liberals and had even rooted out some fascists on purpose. Anyway, it was the final round, liberals and fascist cards were tied and an (Unbeknownst to me) undercover fascist was the president. After about five minutes of people begging the president to give me the chancellorship, we finally voted on me and I jumped up yelling \"DEUTSCHLAND\" and I had pulled off the most perfect match ever. So a few minutes later we're all sitting back in the main room and I over hear some guys saying 'we have to do this again sometime.' and me thinking they were talking about a later free time, asked if I could come along. As it turns out they were talking about back at their houses which I was in fact invited too. So the retreat ends and we all go home. Two weeks later, a guy holds the Secret Hitler game at his house, needless to say I hit it off very well with the group and become more or less of an official member of the group. A few weeks go by and a member of the group tells me he could hook me up with a prom date because I really knew no one. I agree and we text for a bit and she is very genuine and nice. We go to prom and it is one of the best nights of my life, and I'm just astounded that I'm here just because of some board game. Thank you Goat, Wolf, & Cabbage, I couldn't have done it without you.",

      "You have stumbled across an uncharted island rich in natural resources, but you are not alone; other adventurers have come ashore too, and the race to settle the island of Catan has begun! Whether you exert military force, build a road to rival the Great Wall, trade goods with ships from the outside world, or some combination of all three, the aim is the same: to dominate the island. Will you prevail? Proceed strategically, trade wisely, and may the odds be in favour.",
